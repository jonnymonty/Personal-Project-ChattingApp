## Reflection

  - I have been following along with [AngelSix's](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLrW43fNmjaQVYF4zgsD0oL9Iv6u23PI6M) informational youtube playlist.
  - I gained a bunch of useful knowledge on this coding journey, such as deadlocks and how to prevent them, custom styling for things such as scroll bar, popup menus, and even the window itself and also ikscape/path markup syntax.
  - One of the more interesting things I've learned from this are storyboard animations and using event triggers to activate the animations.
